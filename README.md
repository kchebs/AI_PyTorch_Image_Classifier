# AI Programming with Python Project

In this project, I developed code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then converted it into a command line application.

Getting Started
To simply view the report, open Image Classifier Project.ipynb or Image Classifier Project.html. To edit or view the code, open Image Classifier Project.ipynb or one of the subsequent .py files.

Prerequisites
This project requires Python. You can download and install Python from the Python.org. It was constructed using the free Jupyter Notebooks software.

Installing
Besides installing the necessary programming language, software, and software packages that are imported in the beginning of the code, no other installation is needed.
